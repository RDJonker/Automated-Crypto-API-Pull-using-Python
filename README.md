# Automated Crypto API Pull using Python

In this project I created an automated process to pull data from a crypto currencty website using an API and then requesting the data for 15 different crypto currencies. The data was then tranformed and read into a csv file. The data was cleaned and the visualized based on the different price changes over different time periods.
